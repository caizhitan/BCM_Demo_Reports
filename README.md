# BCM_Reports
## A little infomation about BCM.
Bus operators like SBS Transit, SMRT used to own their own Bus Fleet and manage their own Bus Routes under Bus Service Operating Licence (BSOL). However after 1 Sept 2016 LTA implemented the Bus Contracting Model (BCM). Under BCM, LTA now owns all buses, infrastructure and depots, Bus Routes are also openly bidded to the highest bidder to operate the Bus Route. In return LTA can allocate more or less buses to the Bus Routes that require them. Bus Operators are paid a fixed rate to operate the Bus Service while LTA collects the fare revenue which allows Bus Operators to focus on providing a reliable Bus Service to the public instead of focusing on revenue.

This project is relevant to when LTA switched to Bus Contracting Model (BCM). (2016-Present)

## How my work has any relevance to real-life scenarios.
If you live in Singapore and frequently take the Bus to commute to School/Work/Anywhere, you may have seen these posters online or at the Bus Stops.

There was a period where the public was unhappy with LTA's decision to remove Bus 167 and thus LTA decided to change the frequency of Bus 167 to 30 minutes interval. (This is important as I will be discussing about this later below)
